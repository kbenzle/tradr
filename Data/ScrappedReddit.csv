That's because the ecosystem's most popular decentralized exchange, Uniswap, released its V3 system, which notably became the first DEX to express its pools' liquidity provider positions as NFTs. Indeed, a Uniswap V3 NFT is akin to a digital deed representing a unique Uniswap LP position - say $1,337 USD worth of DAI-USDC liquidity provided at the $0.99-$1.01 price range and within the 0.05% fee tier. What remains to be seen is the actual specifics of how Aave will handle and facilitate such common shared positions, but it's precisely these shared positions that will provide an avenue for the lending protocol to readily offer liquidity and services around the underlying NFTs. Moreover, as NFTs continue to proliferate throughout DeFi, it's reasonable to assume that Aave will add support for more NFTs beyond Uniswap V3 in time.""]}, {'timestamp': '37 minutes ago', 'comments': '2', 'comments_on_post': ['Who Is Satoshi Nakamoto, The Creator of BItcoin?', 'I think he is a she.

Obviously price movement is still volatile in Bitcoin but as more and more people move to DCAing or simply holding a certain amount the price of Bitcoin will likely look more like golds modern price activity ( an important distinction from before when gold was considered the reserve currency). In the event that all or a large number governments accept Bitcoin as legal tender it would like become the world reserve currency as a way for countries to do business with each other which at the moment is currently mainly the job of USD in that case the price of Bitcoin would likely move only in relation to it's price against the currencies inflating around it.
